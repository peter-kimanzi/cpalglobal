									<p>   Dear reader, welcome to CARRER PAL GLOBAL and discover how best we can be of value to you as we have  been for others over  the last 10years. The following sponsored programs are offered by Career pal to empower the world through the following Programs:</p>
									<h1>1. EDUCATION</h1>

								<p>In conjunction with our partners around the world we have been able to offer partial and full scholarships of all levels both online and physical learning.

									<p>French, Germany or Spanish depending on the parents’ choice.

Here the skills are offered for free so long as the parent is a member of this pal, with just a subscription fee of Ksh 48 monthly.</p>

								<h2>2. CAREER SOLUTIONS:</h2>
								<p>    Career forms part of our development in a bigger way. Millions of professionals outside there do not have jobs or are unhappy with what they do due to little pay with harsh working conditions. Do you know that currently Kenya receives a recognizable percentage of remittances form Kenyans at the diaspora? A percent which if the government was to borrow then the national debt would shoot to the roof. 90% of Kenyans working abroad got these chances via friends. Whether you are a student or you are already working the path to getting local and international job is simply to connect with those who are exposed to those opportunities. That’s why this pal connects professionals in college or at work with their counterparts in the same career field so that they can link and absorb one another (Show me your friends today and I will show you your future.) </p>
								<p> In Kenya today most of the students are learning so that they can start searching for jobs after completion without realizing that they are supposed to create networks with possible employers while still at campus level with as many as possible to facilitate job opportunities which they will just choose where to work and not to tarmac. This pal will give you hints, trainings and possible volunteer leads.</p>
